## mkdir
``` 
mkdir inClassHomework
```
This resourse is called *Make Directory*. This can be used in your **terminal** when you are trying to create folders inside of your directories. 
An example of how I would use this:
1. I want to create a folder inside of my directory for my in class homework 
2. I will use use the code block text to create it 
3. Once this is ran I will have a new folder created called _inClassHomework_.
